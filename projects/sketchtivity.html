          <p>SketchTivity is an NSF-funded research project being developed at the Sketch Recognition Lab for teaching basic drawing skills. I lead the design and development of the system and it is the topic of my dissertation. We focus on a practical form of drawing known as design sketching or conceptual sketching, with a special emphasis on teaching engineers the skill.</p>
          <p>The sofware has been implemented in 3 high schools and at Georgia Tech's Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design programs, and we have ongoing studies to evaluate its effectiveness at improving basic sketching ability.</p>
          <p>We utilize sketch recognition to give real-time feedback as people learn fundamentals of sketching. We explore different ways of doing this by extracting various features from sketches. We also utlize proven concepts in education theory like mastery learning, and self-regulated learning to motivate students to practice and develop their skills.</p>

          <p>Drawing is a skill that can be difficult to learn for many people. The act of drawing is complex and relies on many different physical and cognitive functions working together including fine motor control, spatial reasoning, hand-eye coordination, visual memory, perception, and so on. Mastery of the skill requires a great deal of effort and many hours of practice. Many people have low self-efficacy with regards to sketching, and this hinders their ability to improve and master the skill.</p>
          <p>One of the biggest problems with traditional pedagogy - Studio environments is the <b>comparison to peers and lack of feeling any sense of achievement</b> for many people. It often leads to feelings of <b>learned helplessness</b>. It's also difficult for teachers to cater their teaching to individual students. They simply don't have the time our resources to always individualize the learning experience.</p>

            <p>My research has led to me realize the major difference between beginners who struggle at sketching and their more advanced peers is self-efficacy. I believe there is an important theoretical “threshold” which shifts a beginners mindset and leads to further mastery of sketching. Some people reach this threshold quickly and easily, others struggle.  Either way, at this point the learner is:</br>
              - Beginning to unlearn any negative thought patterns that kept them from improving drawing skills i.e. “I’m not a good at drawing” or “I’m just not creative / artistic” Beginning to be encouraged by seeing peer’s work, rather than discouraged. (Peers should still be around the same level of mastery)</br>
              - Are more likely to take control of their learning experience (self-regulated learning)</br>
              - May gain a more intrinsic desire to improve sketching ability without relying on external praise or external motivators.</br></p>
            <!-- <p>In order to determine how gaming elements could be implemented, I developed a motivation model inspired by the works of Richard Bartle (Bartle Test) and Jon Radoff.  With the survey results, I was able to see how motivation is different from person to person and also changes based on skill level. Ultimately this had led to the design decision that the software should initially be achievement based (extrinsic motivator), but then eventually allow for many other motivators as the user becomes more confident, and becomes more intrinsically motivated to get better.</p> -->

            <p>Since learning sketching is very much about practice, it was important early on to interview individuals with various skill levels (from novice to expert) to understand how motivations to practice sketching shift over time. As it turns out, the motivations largely follow Self Determination Theory - Individuals tend to be more extrinsically motivated at first (seeking praise, positive feedback, or other external rewards), then as their skill improves they need to be more intrinsically motivated to master the skill so that they can utilize it for collaboration, creativity, etc.</p>
            <p>This allowed for the creation of 3 personas based on skill level.</p>

           <p>After practicing basic primitives in perspective, it becomes important to practice one's sketching skills on actual objects. A common exercise is the "city street" in perspective. I developed an algorithm and designed / prototyped an  intelligent interface that can provide real-time feedback and assessment on any rectilinear perspective sketch. I also tested it in an experimental split study with 40 participants. Through the study I was able to prove that students receiving the intelligent feedback can make statistically significant improvements in the accuracy of their perspective drawings.</p>

           <p>After finishing my PhD I spun out a web app from the research called <a href="https://www.drawdojo.com" target="blank">DrawDojo</a>. DrawDojo is an ongoing project to practice app design and development, and share resources related to teaching drawing. It can be used on any tablet device to practice basic drawing skills.</p>
